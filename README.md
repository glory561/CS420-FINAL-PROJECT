GloLang
GloLang is a small custom programming language made with Python. It has its own system for reading code (lexer), understanding it (parser), running it (interpreter), and managing the program while it runs (runtime environment). Everything was built from the ground up. GloLang is made to be easy to read and write. It is a good tool for learning how programming languages work, practicing scripting logic, and solving basic programming problems.

Features
GloLang includes many useful parts found in modern programming languages:

Variables and math expressions
You can store values using VAR and do simple math like x + 3. Example:
VAR x = 5

Control flow (making decisions and loops)
Use IF, ELIF, and ELSE for conditions. Use WHILE and FOR for loops.

Functions
Define reusable blocks of code with FUN. Example:
FUN add(a, b) -> a + b

Lists
Create lists and use built-in commands like APPEND to add items, LEN to get the length, and POP to remove items.

Built-in functions
GloLang includes basic functions like:

PRINT: to show output

INPUT: to take input from the user

RUN: to run another script

CLEAR: to clear the screen

Error handling
If your program has a mistake, GloLang will try to show a helpful error message.

Example Programs
Here are some small programs you can write and run using GloLang:

hello_world.glo – prints a greeting on the screen

math_test.glo – shows how math expressions work

fizzbuzz.glo – solves the FizzBuzz challenge

list_operations.glo – works with lists and shows how to use list commands
